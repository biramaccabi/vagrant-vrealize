# How To Contribute

We want your patches!  `vagrant-vrealize` isn't done yet, and anything
you've got to contribute will be gratefully received.

If there's something you want to add:

1. Make a local branch, give it a meaningful name
2. Make your change
3. Push the branch to github
4. Make a pull request to `master`.
5. It'll be reviewed, QA'd, and hopefully merged.

If you're contributing a complete feature or a bug-fix, this will
probably trigger a version bump and a release of the gem, but I'll
take care of that.
